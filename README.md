Programs:

1.) sortingAlgs
	
	About: This program has insertion, merge, and quick sort all in one program

2.) closestPairPoints
	
	About: This calculates the pair of the closest distance
	Uses a modified merge sort that I made to which accepts two points and sorts them with respect to their coordinate. Code works fine, but I'm pretty sure there's a much better way of of getting the points of delta. 

	Notes: WORK IN PROGRESS. I will update this program in the future if time permits so it has a better run time.
